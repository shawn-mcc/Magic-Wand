## A Notice about Sources

Please note that the sources presented here and are for reference & transparency purposes only. The **only** file you need to successfully run the application is the exe file. Please see below for a brief description of the files:

#### Shawns_Magic_Wand.ps1
- This is the main file containing the script that executes when the exe file is ran. It handles both ritual types, the code for dynamically generated templates, and the "Grand Finale" function that runs after reboot. This and Spell_Components.json are the only 2 files bundled into the exe.

#### Shawns_Magic_Wand.SED
- This is the Self-Extraction Directive (SED) file generated by IExpress in order to convert the ps1 file into an exe. It specifies which files should be included, how they should be installed, and any other commands that should be executed during installation.
