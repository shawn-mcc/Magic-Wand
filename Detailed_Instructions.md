# Shawn's Magic Wand

##  Detailed Instructions

  

#### Version 2.0.0

  

Thank you for choosing Shawn's Magic Wand! This is an open-source, self-deleting application meant to help with initial PC setups as well as typical tune up style maintenance. As the dedicated Tech Geek out of my friends and family, I developed this program in my free time in order to help them with their basic computer needs without me having to remote into their PC every time "it started running slow" or they "needed a new laptop setup". As I've developed it, I've actually grown quite fond of it and would like to continue improving it over time as my schedule allows. Please see the changelog for more details about this version and where I plan to go next with the application.
