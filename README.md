# Magic-Wand
A PS script to make new PC setups &amp; Tune Up's Eaiser

## Instructions
- Copy Shawn's Magic Wand on the *Desktop* of the computer (DO NOT RENAME THE FILE)
- In your windows searchbar, type ISE
- Look for Powershell ISE, and *run it as an administrator* (The command below will not run if you do not)
- Type the following into the terminal:

 > Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass 

- Select "Yes to All" in the dialogue box (Don't worry, the script will undo these settings after it has finished to ensure user security)
- In ISE, go to the top and click file -> open
- Navigate to the Desktop folder and open Shawns_Magic_Wand.ps1 in ISE
- Drag the blue terminal screen up (Do not modify the code in the white text editor field)
- Click the green arrow to begin running the program
- Thats it! The wizard himself will guide you through the rest!

- NOTE: This program deletes itself after running. If you'd like to keep a copy of it, it is highly recomended to keep it on something like a flash drive and copy it onto Dekstops of computers you're working on. You can ignore this if you're running it one time on a personal device.
