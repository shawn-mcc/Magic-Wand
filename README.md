## Instructions
- Copy Shawn's Magic Wand on the Desktop of the computer (DO NOT RENAME THE FILE)

- If the script starts giving errors before you select an option, you may need to enable PS,detailed below.
- Thats it! The wizard himself will guide you through the rest!

- NOTE: This program deletes itself after running. If you'd like to keep a copy of it, it is highly recomended to keep it on something like a flash drive and copy it onto Dekstops of computers you're working on. You can ignore this if you're running it one time on a personal device.
