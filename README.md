# Shawn's Magic Wand

### New PC setups &amp; Tune Up's made easy.

  

#### Version 2.0.1

  

Thank you for choosing Shawn's Magic Wand! This is an open-source, self-deleting application meant to help with initial PC setups as well as typical tune up style maintenance. As the dedicated Tech Geek out of my friends and family, I developed this program in my free time in order to help them with their basic computer needs without me having to remote into their PC every time "it started running slow" or they "needed a new laptop setup". As I've developed it, I've actually grown quite fond of it and would like to continue improving it over time as my schedule allows. Please see the changelog for more details about this version and where I plan to go next with the application.

  

## Instructions

  

If you are totally unfamiliar with GitHub and need detailed instructions, please click "Detailed_Instructions.md" (That means you Pop and Aunt Donna), otherwise, please see general instructions below:

  

- 1: Download & extract the exe file. This is the only file you will need. Feel free to delete the rest.

	- *NOTE: This application deletes itself after running. It is highly recommended that you keep it on a flash drive or other removable media if you intend to use it on multiple machines. It will **NOT** delete extra files from the download/extraction if you download the entire repo from GitHub*

- 2: Copy Shawns_Magic_Wand.exe to your Desktop and run it **as an administrator**

	- *NOTE: **DO NOT** attempt to rename file or it will cause issues. The Wizard will let you know if it is not running as an administrator and prompt you to restart the program if it does not have the required privileges.*
	
	- *NOTE: If you have your Desktop synced with OneDrive, the Wizard may fail to recognize it is located on the desktop. This is because the OneDrive Desktop is located at **C:\Users\USERNAME\OneDrive\Desktop** and the Magic Wand explicitly looks for a path at **C:\Users\USERNAME\Desktop**. If this is the case, please manually navigate to the local desktop and place the application there. I will be fixing this issue in a future relase.*

- 3: If everything goes well, the Wizard should be able to guide you through the rest of the process. Please see the changelog for more specific details.
