# Magic-Wand
A PS script to make new PC setups &amp; Tune Up's Eaiser

## Instructions
- Copy Shawn's Magic Wand on the Desktop of the computer
- NOTE: This program deletes itself after running. If you'd like to keep a copy of it, it is highly recomended to keep it on something like a flash drive and copy it onto Dekstops of computers you're working on. You can ignore this if you're running it one time on a personal device.
- Right click on Shawn's Magic Wand on the Desktop and click Run With Powershell. You may need to approve UAC
- Thats it! The wizard himself will guide you through the rest!
